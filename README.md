# Python for Data Analysis: Mobile User Behavior

This project is a part of a daily Python exercise series designed to build data analysis skills. The dataset used in this project focuses on mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification. It contains 700 samples of user data, including metrics like app usage time, screen-on time, battery consumption, and mobile data usage. The goal of this project is to explore, analyze, and model user behavior based on these data points.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides information about:

- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **Device Model**: The model of the user's smartphone.
- **Operating System**: The operating system of the device (iOS or Android).
- **App Usage Time**: Daily time spent using mobile applications (in minutes).
- **Screen On Time**: Average number of hours per day the screen is active.
- **Battery Drain**: Daily battery consumption (in mAh).
- **Number of Apps Installed**: The total number of apps installed on the device.
- **Data Usage**: Daily mobile data consumption (in megabytes).
- **Age**: Age of the user.
- **Gender**: Gender of the user (Male or Female).
- **User Behavior Class**: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns, ranging from light to extreme usage (1 to 5).

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project include:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is ready for analysis by checking for missing values, duplicates, and potential outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover trends and insights through visualizations and descriptive statistics.
3. **User Behavior Classification**: Group users based on their behavior and analyze the differences in usage patterns.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict user behavior based on the available features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a series of daily tasks, with each day focusing on a different aspect of the dataset or a data analysis technique:

- **Day 1**: Initial data exploration, loading the dataset, and understanding its structure.
- **Day 2**: Data cleaning, identifying missing or inconsistent data.
- **Day 3**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and correlation analysis.
- **Day 4**: Grouping users by behavior and comparing key metrics.
- **Day 5**: Working with categorical data and preparing it for modeling.

## Technologies and Tools

The project makes use of the following Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For predictive modeling and machine learning.
